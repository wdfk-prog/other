# Technical Documents and Resources

This directory contains a collection of technical documents, datasheets, and reference manuals, primarily focused on **ARM architecture** and **embedded systems design**.

## File Index

Here is a brief description of each file in this collection:

-   **`05_Thumb.pdf`**
    -   A reference document detailing the ARM **Thumb instruction set**, which is a 16/32-bit instruction set designed for code density.

-   **`2792846233RV043056B0.pdf`**
    -   The datasheet for an **RFID module**, likely the `RV-43-C56B` model. It contains technical specifications and usage instructions.

-   **`DDI0406C_d_armv7ar_arm.pdf`**
    -   The official **ARM Architecture Reference Manual for ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R profiles**. This is a comprehensive and authoritative guide covering the architecture in detail.

-   **`How_To_Design_Multiple_Tasks_Embedded_System_Demo.pdf`**
    -   A guide or tutorial on designing **multi-tasking embedded systems**. It likely covers topics such as real-time operating systems (RTOS), task scheduling, and inter-task communication.

-   **`ourdev_570540.pdf`**
    -   A technical article from the "OurDev" (电子开发网) community. The content is related to the analysis of the **ARM Cortex-M startup file** (e.g., for STM32 microcontrollers).

-   **`LICENSE`**
    -   Contains the license terms for this collection.
